module MembersHelper
  # Adds a link that either:
  # * sends a delete request to memberships in case only one role is assigned to the member
  # * sends a patch request to memberships in case there is more than one role assigned to the member
  #
  # If it is the later, the ids of the non delete roles are appended to the url so that they are kept.
