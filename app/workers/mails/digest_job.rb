  # a job is scheduled unless there is no prior digest notification that is not yet read (read_mail_digest: true).
  # If we were to only set the read_mail_digest state at the end of the mail rendering an edge case of the following
  # would lead to digest not being sent or at least sent unduly late:
  # * Job starts and fetches the notifications for rendering. We need to fetch all notifications to be rendered to
  #   order them as desired.
  # * Notification is created. Because there are unhandled digest notifications no job is scheduled.
  # * The above can happen repeatedly.
  # * Job ends.
  # * No new notification is generated.
  #
  # A new job would then only be scheduled upon the creation of a new digest notification which (as unlikely as that is)
  # might only happen after some days have gone by.
  #
  # Because we mark the notifications as read even though they in fact aren't, we do it in a transaction
  # so that the change is rolled back in case of an error.
