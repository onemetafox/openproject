  - Attachments
  description: |-
    Clients can create attachments without a container first and attach them later on.
    This is useful if the container does not exist at the time the attachment is uploaded.
    After the upload, the client can then claim such containerless attachments for any resource eligible (e.g. WorkPackage) on subsequent requests.
    The upload and the claiming *must* be done for the same user account. Attachments uploaded by another user cannot be claimed and
    once claimed for a resource, they cannot be claimed by another.

    The upload request must be of type `multipart/form-data` with exactly two parts.

    The first part *must* be called `metadata`. Its content type is expected to be `application/json`,
    the body *must* be a single JSON object, containing at least the `fileName` and optionally the attachments `description`.

    The second part *must* be called `file`, its content type *should* match the mime type of the file.
    The body *must* be the raw content of the file.
    Note that a `filename` *must* be indicated in the `Content-Disposition` of this part, although it will be ignored.
    Instead the `fileName` inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used.
