        Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions.

        **Required permission:** edit permission for the container of the attachment or being the author for attachments without container

        *Note that you will only receive this error, if you are at least allowed to see the attachment.*

        Returned if the attachment does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
        to see it.

        **Required permission:** view permission for the container of the attachment or being the author for attachments without container

        *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of an attachment.
        That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*
