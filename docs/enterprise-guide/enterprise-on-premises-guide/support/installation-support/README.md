# Installation support for Enterprise on-premises

 We deliver the confidence of a tested, supported and certified enterprise-class business application.  

If you want to work with OpenProject Enterprise on-premises but do not have a Community Edition running, you can order **installation support** during the [booking process of your Enterprise on-premises edition](../../activate-enterprise-on-premises).

The cost for the installation support of a Community version is 150 â‚¬ (excluding VAT). In the price there is no migration included. If you need migration support, please [contact us](mailto:info@openproject.com) for a detailed quotation.



## Installation checklist

Please have a look at our [installation checklist](https://www.openproject.org/assets/pdf/OpenProject_Installation_Checklist_v1.8.pdf) and send us the completed document prior to the on-premise installation.
