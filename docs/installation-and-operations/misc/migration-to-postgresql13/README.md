# Migrating your OpenProject installation to PostgreSQL 13

OpenProject version 12+ will default to PostgreSQL 13. If you have an existing OpenProject installation, please follow the guide below to upgrade your PostgreSQL version.

## Package-based installation

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Please follow this section only if you have installed OpenProject using [this procedure][package-based-installation].

Before attempting the upgrade, please ensure you have performed a backup of your installation by following the [backup guide](../../operation/backing-up/).
</div>

In the following, we assume that you initially let OpenProject setup your PostgreSQL installation, using a local database. If you are using an external database, please follow the instructions from your provider, or adapt the instructions given below.

1. First, connect to your server and make sure your local version is PostgreSQL v10:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/postgresql/10/main/PG_VERSION
10
```

2. Install the new version of PostgreSQL:

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-13
```

For RedHat/CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum install postgresql-13
```

For SLES:

```bash
sudo zypper install postgresql-13
```

3. Stop the PostgreSQL servers:

```bash
sudo su - postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl stop --wait --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/10/main"
sudo su - postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl stop --wait --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/13/main"
```

4. Migrate your data to PostgreSQL 13:

```bash
sudo su - postgres <<CMD
/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir=/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin \
  --new-bindir=/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \
  --old-datadir=/var/lib/postgresql/10/main \
  --new-datadir=/var/lib/postgresql/13/main \
  --old-options '-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf' \
  --new-options '-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf'
CMD

5. Make PostgreSQL v13 the new default server to run on port 45432:

```bash
sudo su - postgres -c "cp /etc/postgresql/{10,13}/main/conf.d/custom.conf"
sudo su - postgres -c "sed -i 's|45432|45433|' /etc/postgresql/10/main/conf.d/custom.conf"
sudo su - postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl start --wait --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/13/main -o '-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf'"
```

6. Check your OpenProject installation. A version higher than `13` should be displayed for `PostgreSQL version` in the "Administration > Information" section.

7. If everything is fine, you can then remove your older PostgreSQL installation:

```bash
rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/10/main
# you can optionally go further and purge postgresql-10 from your system if you wish
sudo apt-get purge postgresql-10 # debian/ubuntu
sudo yum remove postgresql-10 # rhel/centos
sudo zypper remove postgresql-10 # sles
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Refresh your package list:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get -y install postgresql-13
```

## Compose-based docker installation

## All-in-one docker installation

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Please follow this section only if you have installed OpenProject using [this procedure][all-in-one-docker-installation].

Before attempting the upgrade, please ensure you have performed a backup of your installation by following the [backup guide](../../operation/backing-up/).
</div>

The newer version of OpenProject includes an utility to automatically perform the upgrade for you. Assuming you followed the standard installation procedure, the folder (within the docker container) containing your PostgreSQL data will be located at `/var/openproject/pgdata`.

Then the goal is to take this folder, and apply `pg_upgrade` on it. This will generate an upgraded cluster in another folder. We can finally switch the old postgres folder with the upgraded one and restart the container.

First, ensure that you have stopped your container:

```bash
docker stop openproject
```

Once the docker has stopped, you are ready to run the upgrade command. In this case, we assume that your existing PostgreSQL data is stored on the host at `/var/lib/openproject/pgdata`. We will also map a local folder named `/var/lib/openproject/pgdata-next` to a special volume in the container, named `/var/openproject/pgdata-next`. This volume will contain the upgraded cluster:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v /var/lib/openproject/pgdata:/var/openproject/pgdata \
  -v /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-next:/var/openproject/pgdata-next \
  openproject/community:12 root ./docker/prod/postgres-db-upgrade
```

If everything goes well, the process should end with a message as follows:

```
Upgrade Complete                                              
----------------                                              
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade so,                  
once you start the new server, consider running:
    ./analyze_new_cluster.sh                                
                                         
Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh            
```

You can then perform the following operation to switch the upgraded PostgreSQL with the older version:

```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/openproject/pgdata /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-prev
sudo mv /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-next /var/lib/openproject/pgdata
```

Finally, you can restart OpenProject with the same command that you used before. For instance:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name openproject -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret \
  -v /var/lib/openproject/pgdata:/var/openproject/pgdata \
  -v /var/lib/openproject/assets:/var/openproject/assets \
  [...]
  openproject/community:12

If your new installation looks fine, you can then choose to remove `/var/lib/openproject/pgdata-prev`:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-prev
```

If you encounter an issue, you can switch back to the previous PostgreSQL folder by reverting the folder switch:

```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/openproject/pgdata /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-next
sudo mv /var/lib/openproject/pgdata-prev /var/lib/openproject/pgdata
```

And then restart OpenProject.
