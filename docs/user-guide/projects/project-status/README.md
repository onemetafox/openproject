## Setting the project status

You can set your project status in the **project settings**. For this, click on **project settings** in the menu on the left and then select the relevant status. To add more information to your project status, you can use the status description directly underneath to manually describe changes, project KPIs etc.

If the widget is not yet displayed on the project overview, you can add the project status to your **project overview** widget by clicking on **+** at the top right corner. Then you can choose where you would like to position your additional widget by clicking on the respective **+** at the top, bottom, left or right of existing widgets.

## FAQ

### Can I create a custom project status?

There are three project status to choose from: on track, at risk and off track. These cannot be changed. However, if you want to add additional information, you can do so in the status description or you can create an additional [project custom field](../../../system-admin-guide/custom-fields/custom-fields-projects/). Both, status description and the project custom field can be displayed in the **project list**.
